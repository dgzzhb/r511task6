            <p>The Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) has defined educational technology as "the study and ethical practice
                of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating, using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources".
                It denotes instructional technology as "the theory and practice of design, development, utilization, management, and evaluation of processes
                and resources for learning". As such, educational technology refers to all valid and reliable applied education sciences, such as equipment,
                as well as processes and procedures that are derived from scientific research, and in a given context may refer to theoretical, algorithmic 
                or heuristic processes: it does not necessarily imply physical technology. Educational technology is the process of integrating technology

                                process occurs and proposed nine instructional events to support these
                                stages, fostering effective learning strategies.</p>

                            <p>Gilbert was a pivotal figure in performance improvement, distinguishing
                                between what he called “behavioral engineering” and “worthy performance.”
                                His work emphasized the importance of environmental factors in enhancing
                                human performance.</p>
