            <p>Instructional Technology (IT) involves creating, developing, managing, improving, and evaluating 
                learning resources for educational purposes within educational settings. These settings can be 
                formal (i.e., schools or higher education institutions) or informal (i.e., MOOCs, 
                micro-credentials, videos for training or educational purposes).

                Human Performance Technology (HPT) is a systematic process of improving people’s performance. 
                It is important to evaluate the people’s performance before starting the process to create a
                systematic plan that meets their needs.

                Gagne (1987) states that in the 1800s, German educator John Herbart proposed that educational instructional practices should be based on scientific research. Josef Mayer Rice, an American educator, conducted many studies in the American school systems in the 1890s. During the 1920s, there was a huge interest in empirical methods to help solve problems in education. W.W. Charters and Franklin Bobbitt were pioneers in job-task analysis and objective specification. After that, the Great Depression and the progressive educational movement helped to develop the field. When the US joined World War II, it needed to train many people quickly; many psychologists conducted experimental research to develop training materials. These training materials were derived from research and theory of instructions. After World War II, specifically in the mid-1950s, two factors helped develop the systems approach concept: the programmed instruction movement and the refinement of task analysis procedures. Then, in the early 1960s, another factor helped to develop the systems approach concept, which was the emergence of criterion-referenced testing. At the same time, the concepts of task analysis, objectives, specifications, and criterion-referenced testing were brought together in articles by many scholars, especially Gagne. These scholars helped to develop the terms: “systems development,” “systematic instructions,” and “instructional system” to describe systems approach like what we have today.

                Stolovitch et al. (1999) state that the roots of Human Performance Technology go back to Skinner's work on how small-step instruction and extensive feedback could significantly enhance learning.  They add that Skinner’s cause-and-effect discoveries developed the field (e.g., machine teaching (in the 1950s), instructional design process (in the 1960s), and computer-assisted instruction (in the 1960s). They highlighted that developing research and theory in other fields helped develop the Human Performance Technology (HPT) field (e.g., systems theory, learning psychology, instructional systems design, cognitive engineering, information technology, ergonomics and human factors engineering, psychometrics, feedback systems, and organizational development. They add that some practitioners who came from other fields and served as managers helped develop the field with new ideas.

            <h3>Here are some big ideas in the field.<span class="animate scroll" style="--i:3;"></span></h3>
            <p><b>Blended Learning</b>: Combining online digital media with traditional classroom methods, blended learning has emerged as a balanced approach that provides flexibility and effectiveness in instruction.
                <span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses)</b>:  MOOCs have democratized learning, making high-quality education accessible to anyone with an internet connection. This has been a game-changer in lifelong learning and professional development.
                <span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Gamification</b>:  Incorporating game design elements in non-game contexts, gamification has been widely adopted to engage learners and enhance their motivation and participation in both educational and professional settings.
                <span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Adaptive Learning Technologies</b>: These technologies use AI to adapt content to the learner's individual needs, offering a personalized learning path that adjusts in real-time to the learner's performance and engagement level.
                <span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Performance Support Systems</b>: These systems provide on-the-job access to personalized and situational knowledge, thereby enhancing performance by reducing the gap between learning and applying skills in real-world contexts.
                <span class="animate scroll" style="--i:4;"></span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Learning Analytics</b>: The use of data analytics tools in instructional technology helps educators understand and optimize learning and the environments in which it occurs. Learning analytics has become vital in the assessment and enhancement of learner engagement and success.
